WindowTester Pro is a UI test generation tool for testing SWT and Swing Java applications. WindowTester Pro&nbsp;eliminates the need to
manually create
test cases to test GUIs by automating the process of GUI
testing. Using WindowTester Pro,
developers can easily create tests for every GUI
they create. Automating
GUI testing increases the productivity of both the
developer and the QA
team. WindowTester Pro empowers developers with testing
capabilities and reduces
the time required to hand-code tests. This enables
developers to build quality
into the product early in the process because problems are
found and resolved
earlier in the development cycle. Using WindowTester Pro
helps developers
and companies drastically lower both testing time and
cost&mdash;it is not uncommon
to save up to 50% or more of time required to write the
tests.<br><br>The tests generated by WindowTester Pro are standard JUnit
tests thus they can be run within your Eclipse environment or they can
be <a href="automating_tests.html">automated to run using Ant</a>.
Typically, tests are recorded on projects within your Eclipse
environment. If your want to test against a deployed application, you
must first <a href="../gettingstarted/importing_deployed_rcp_app.html">import your application</a> into your Eclipse environment.<br><br>Related Topics:<br><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="generating_tests.html">Generating&nbsp;tests</a></li><li><a href="running_tests.html">Running Tests</a></li></ul>
