<body><h1>Continuously Running WindowTester Pro Tests</h1><p>WindowTester Pro
easily integrates into continuous build systems including Ant, Maven,
Hudson and Cruise Control. This tight integration ensures that the
&ldquo;correctness&rdquo;of an application is tested each time the application is built. </p><p>
To be able to run WindowTester Pro tests in a continuous build environment,
the  machine you will be running the tests on must have a graphical interface and a user
account.  Some servers strictly use command line, in which case, WindowTester Pro tests won't run. In addition, it appears that the user must be logged in at the
time that the tests are executed (at least on Windows) or the
applications under test may not have access to the appropriate UI
resources (console, graphics area, ...) for the tests to successfully
execute. Typically build servers are run without an installed UI
therefore we recommend that WindowTester Pro tests be executed on dedicated
test machines separate from the build server and the test results
uploaded back to the build server for collation.</p>
