<h2 id="StabilityMaintenance">Stability/Maintenance</h2>
<p>This release contains a number of fixes to improve the overall
stability of the product.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Compound Keystroke Dispatch Fixes</i> - Certain compound
keystrokes (e.g., <code>WT.SHIFT|WT.ARROW_RIGHT</code>) were not
being posted properly on some machines. A fix has been introduced
to make this dispatch more reliable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>XY calculation in figure dragTo operations</i> - The XY
offset of figure drag operations was wrongly being calculated from
the target figure&rsquo;s center. This has now been fixed to be
based on the (expected) top left corner.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>TreeCellLocator fixes</i> - A bug preventing qualified
locators (e.g., cells in views) from being properly constructed has
been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>A number of improvements have been made to the product
documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <a href="programmer/index.html">programmer&rsquo;s
guide</a> has been added to the product documentation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>API Quick Reference Card</i> - A new <a href=
"programmer/core/wtQuickRef.pdf">API Quick Reference Card</a> has
been added to the documentation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Javaodc fixes</i> - Due to malformed html in a package
description, the API Summary doc was not being properly built; this
has now been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Runtime">Runtime</h2>
<p>WindowTester Pro core runtime improvements include the
following.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>ComboLocator</i> - A new <code>ComboLocator</code> has been
introduced that can be used to conveniently assert
<code>Combo</code> text values.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Legacy API Migration</i> - Legacy API consolidation and
migration has begun. See this <a href=
"reference/Legacy_API_Phase_Out.html">document</a> for more
details.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Bundle Infrastructure updates</i> - In order to take
advantage of OSGi bundle management best practice, we have begun
the process of creating (and migrating to) bundle manifests for all
the WindowTester Pro bundles. Note: API clients should not be
affected by this move. Please let us know if you are!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>TreeItemLocator improvements</i> -
<code>TreeItemLocator</code> implements <code>HasText</code> and
provides a <code>hasText(..)</code> condition factory method.</li>
