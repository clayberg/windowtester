<h2 id="Runtime">Runtime</h2>
<p>To enrich RCP tests, condition handling support has been added
for eclipse views and perspectives.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>View Condition Handling</i> - Showing and Closed condition
handlers have been implemented for views allowing one to write
expressions such as
<code>ui.ensureThat(view(&ldquo;Search&rdquo;).isShowing())</code>
and
<code>ui.ensureThat(view(&ldquo;Search&rdquo;).isClosed())</code>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Perspective Condition Handling</i> - Active and Closed
condition handlers have been implemented for perspectives allowing
one to write expressions such as
<code>ui.ensureThat(perspective(&ldquo;Debug&rdquo;).isActive())</code>
and
<code>ui.ensureThat(perspective(&ldquo;Debug&rdquo;).isClosed())</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few other notable runtime enhancements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Swing Runtime Drag and Drop</i> - Drag and drop support has
been added to the Swing runtime.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Class Name Based Locators</i> -
<code>SWTWidgetLocator</code> and <code>SwingWidgetLocator</code>
instances can now be constructed using class names (rather than
only <code>Class</code> instances). This works-around cases where a
<code>Class</code> is not visible to the test project.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Turkish Keyboard support</i> - Runtime support for the
Turkish keyboard has been added.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="TargetManagement">Target Management</h2>
<p>WindowTester Pro custom target support has been improved to make
working with GEF-based applications easier.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Target Provisioner GEF Support</i> - The <b>New WindowTester
Pro Target Provisioner</b> wizard has been improved to optionally
allow the addition of WindowTester Pro GEF support bundles to the
created target provisioner.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="StabilityMaintenance">Stability/Maintenance</h2>
<p>This release also contains a number of fixes to improve the
overall stability of the product.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Figure Locator Runtime fixes</i> - interactions with figures
that have no <code>EditDomain</code> associated were causing
internal exceptions. These have now been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>SWT Widget Locator Link text matching fixed</i> - text
values in <code>Link</code> widgets was not being properly matched
by <code>SWTWidgetLocator</code> instances.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>SWT Combo Item selection fixes</i> - <code>Combo</code>
widgets are now tested for enablement before selection is
attempted. This remedies issues where unexpected results were
produced when interacting with disabled combos.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>ContributedToolItemLocator</i> - Fixed for clicks on
Contributed tool items in property pages.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>SWTIdleCondition Fixes for Linux</i> - The
<code>SWTIdleCondition</code> was prone to deadlocks in some rare
cases in Linux; this issue has now been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Widget Selection Fixes for Linux</i> - Widget selections
were prone to deadlocks in some rare cases in Linux; this issue has
now been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>JListLocator</i> - fixed to work with list elements which
have a &ldquo;/&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>OS X Tree Check Fixes</i> - Tree check selections have been
fixed for OS X.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Button Identification Fixes</i> - The recorder was
misidentifying buttons in labeled composites with
<code>LabeledLocator</code> matchers (instead of
<code>ButtonLocator</code> instances); this has now been
fixed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>TableCellLocator Column Index Validation Fixes</i> - The
column index starts from 1 for the first column and so on. If a
column index of 0 is used, an exception is thrown indicating
invalid column index.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Workbench Focus Condition Handling</i> - The focus forcing
condition handler (as used in calls such as
<code>ui.ensureThat(workbench().hasFocus())</code>) has been
fixed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Context Menu Selection Fixes (OS X)</i> - Fixes were made to
address issues with context menu selections on OS X.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>NamedWidgetLocator Fixes</i> -
<code>NamedWidgetLocator</code> instances parameterized with a
class were not respecting the class in their matching. This has now
been fixed.</li>
</ul>
