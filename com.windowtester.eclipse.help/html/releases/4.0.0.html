<h2 id="SWTRuntime">SWT Runtime</h2>
<p>A number of improvements have been made to existing SWT widget
locators.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>TableCellLocator column header support</i> - the
<code>TableCellLocator</code> now supports clicks on Table column
headers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>WizardPageLocator API</i> - API has been added for wizard
page access
(<code>com.windowtester.runtime.swt.locator.jface.WizardPageLocator</code>);
an existing internal class
(<code>com.windowtester.runtime.swt.internal.locator.jface.WizardPageLocator</code>)
has been deprecated in favor of the new API.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>ContributedToolItems</i> - the
<code>ContributedToolItemLocator</code> now supports ToolItems
added via command contributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, assertion support has been tightened up in a number
of areas.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Assertions on combo items</i> - the Combo (and CCombo) item
locator returned <code>true</code> to isVisible if the list could
be found, now <code>true</code> is returned only if the item itself
is found in the list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Assertions on list items</i> - the List item locator
returned <code>true</code> to isVisible if the list could be found,
now <code>true</code> is returned only if the item itself is found
in the list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Assertions on tool item buttons</i> - for some tool item
buttons, isEnabled always returned <code>true</code> if the tool
item could be found, now <code>true</code> is returned only if the
button widget is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Assertions on table items</i> - selection state tests were
not always accurate and have now been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="SwingRuntime">Swing Runtime</h2>
<p>Swing runtime support has been expanded in a number of ways
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Improved embedded Swing locator handling</i> - swing
locators can now be used directly within an SWT UI context to
handle Swing widgets that are embedded in an SWT application.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Assertion API for Swing locators</i> - the appropriate Swing
Locators now support the following assertion-supporting interfaces:
<code>HasText</code>, <code>IsEnabled</code>,
<code>IsSelected</code>, <code>HasFocus</code> and
<code>IsVisible</code>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Internal and nested classes</i> - Added Swing recorder and
runtime support for internal and nested class.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Recording">Recording</h2>
<p>The recording experience has been greatly improved with a new
enhanced recorder UI.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Recorder UI improvements</i> a number of refinements have
been made to the recorder console:
<ul>
<li>a recorder configuration (launcher) tool item has been added to
the view toolbar.</li>
<li>keystrokes are now presented as strings (where appropriate)
rather than individual keystrokes (e.g., <i>&ldquo;Foo&rdquo;
entered</i> rather than the sequence <i>&lsquo;F&rsquo;
pressed</i>, <i>&lsquo;o&rsquo; pressed</i>, <i>&lsquo;o&rsquo;
pressed</i>).</li>
<li>events can now be deleted from the sequence using the
<i>DELETE</i> key.</li>
<li>a special page is presented when there is no active recording
with pointers to help launch new recordings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to UI refinements, a number of core recorder fixes
have been made.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>View Menu Recording</i> - view menu selections are now
properly handled by the recorder.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Hyperlink recording</i> - SWT hyperlink identification in
the recorder has been improved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Link recording</i> - SWT link identification in the recorder
has been improved.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="StabilityMaintenance">Stability/Maintenance</h2>
<p>This release also contains a number of fixes to improve the
overall stability of the product.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Runtime performance fixes</i> - performance has been
optimized in a number of places to address severe performance
issues seen with eclipse 3.5 on systems with hyper-threading
enabled.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Opening perspectives</i> - WindowTester Pro will now
correctly open perspectives in the same window (instead of spawning
a new one).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Combo Item selection issues</i> - combo selection logic has
improved to handle dynamic combos.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Circular dependency removed</i> - a fragment contributed by
WindowTester Pro code coverage functionality was introducing a
bundle dependency cycle; this cycle has now been removed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>(Post context click) menu recording fix</i> - a bug
affecting the recording of top-level menu selections immediately
after a context selection has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Codegen fix for tests with no setup handlers</i> - tests
generated with no setup handlers selected were causing errors to
get reported to the log; this has now been fixed.</li>
</ul>
