makes authoring tests and testing the GUI easy. Consider an example
where a developer will be testing a Contact Manager application. First,
the developer opens the Contact Manager application and launches a
recording&nbsp;session. Next, the developer specifies information such
as the application to&nbsp;test, the type of recording, and command
line settings, The developer then performs tasks within the application
such as clicking buttons, entering text and opening windows
-WindowTester Pro records all the actions. WindowTester Pro aggregates all of
the actions taken during the record and automatically generates a JUnit
test case for the GUI actions. Because the tests are written in Java,
the user can use an editor and view or modify the test code.</p><p>See the <a href="../gettingstarted/rcp_sampletest.html">RCP tests tutorial</a> on how this is done.</p>
