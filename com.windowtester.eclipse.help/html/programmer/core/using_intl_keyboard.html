<body><h1>Using International (Non-US) Keyboards</h1>
<p>In order to enable locale specific keyboard for testing,
insert the following statement at the beginning of the test </p><pre>WT.setLocaleToCurrent();</pre> and <pre>WT.resetLocale()</pre><p> 
at the end of the test to reset the keyboard setting to default settings.</p><p> We currently have support for the following languages:</p><ul><li>
English</li><li>German (Germany)</li><li>Dutch (Belgium)</li><li>French (France)</li><li>Spanish (Spain)</li><li>Swedish (Sweden)</li><li>Japanese (Japan)</li></ul><p>
If the language/locale of the keyboard you are using is not currently
on the list, with your help, we can add support for it. Support
for non-US keyboards can be implemented by adding the corresponding key maps to the database. In
order to do this please make sure you are using the latest build and
follow the steps below:</p><ol><li>Download the <a href="../../../download/MapGenerator.java">MapGenerator</a> java application.</li><li>Run this application on your machine with the non-US keyboard
attached. It will generate one or more *.map files.</li><li>Please send&nbsp;these *.map files to Support and we will fold them into WindowTester Pro.</li><li>We will then let you know when a new build of WindowTester Pro is
available for you to try.</li></ol></body></html>
