<body><h1>Widget Search Algorithm</h1>
<p>If you want to write your own WidgetLocator, you need to understand how the widget finder works.</p><p>

The widget finder searches the current active window for
matches. Locators might match multiple widgets (whether this
case is exceptional depends on whether you use <code>IUIContext.find(..)</code>
or
<code>IUIContext.findAll(..))</code>. As a simple
example, new
<code>ButtonLocator("OK")</code> identifies a Button labeled
"OK" in the current
active window. If there is more than one such button in the
active window, you can disambiguate the search by embellishing the
locator with information about the Button's location in the widget
containment hierarchy. For instance, if the "OK" button of
interest is the child of a Composite (and none other is), </p><pre>new ButtonLocator("OK", new SWTWidgetLocator(Composite.class))</pre>
will uniquely identify it. Wherever possible, you should name
widgets that require disambiguation. For more on matching by
containment look at the
<code>SWTWidgetLocator</code> javadocs.<p></p>
