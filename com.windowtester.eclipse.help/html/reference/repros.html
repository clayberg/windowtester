<h1>Effective Bug Reporting Through Reproduction Test Cases</h1>
<p>The key to a high-bandwidth interaction with the support team is
the effective communication of the issue you are experiencing. The
best way to communicate issues with the WindowTester Pro runtime is
through a testcase that we can run on our end that demonstrates the
problem. Once we can <i>feel your pain</i> we can more easily
diagnose and address it.</p>

<h2 id="WritingGoodReproductions">Writing Good Reproductions</h2>
<p>There are a few ingredients that make up a good test
reproduction. Good reproductions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Isolated</b> -- the test should be runnable in isolation.
Tests that expect the workspace to be in a particular state when
run violate this premise.</li>
<li><b>Standalone</b> -- the test should be as stand-alone as
possible. Ideally the test should be a single class (or package)
that can be imported into a developer&rsquo;s workspace. If
necessary, the test might also be parceled up in a new
project.</li>
<li><b>Lean</b> -- the test should be as minimal as possible. This
means:
<ul>
<li>it should be as simple as possible and</li>
<li>it should introduce a minimal set of dependencies (ideally
none).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="TheSharedTestEnvironment">The Shared Test Environment</h3>
<p>As a baseline environment tests should be written against the
most recent GA of the standard Eclipse IDE. For example all of the
following bits of UI are fair game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Workbench views (<i>Problems</i>, <i>Error Log</i>, etc),
wizards, preferences, and so on</li>
<li>JDT tools (wizards, natures, etc.)</li>
<li>PDE tools</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see this is quite a rich palette for writing
tests!</p>
<h2 id="ThisgoesforFeaturesToo">This goes for Features Too!</h2>
<p>In addition to communicating about bugs, this is also an
effective way to communicate about feature ideas too. Feature
requests that are fleshed out with reproduction driver tests are
much easier for developers to dig into, assess and estimate. They
also provide a good shared language for exchanging ideas.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we are exploring a new feature for a text
editor locator enhancement that adds support for clicking specified
locations in an editor&rsquo;s document and a customer submits
something like this:</p>
<pre>
<code>
public class EditorMarginLocatorTest extends UITestCaseSWT {
	private static class TextAtRowColEqualsCondtion implements IUICondition { ... }
        private static String TEST_TEXT = "text to enter";
	
	@Override
	protected void setUp() throws Exception {
	       super.setUp();
	       createAndOpenDocument();
	}
       private void createAndOpenDocument() { ... }
       public void testDrive() throws Exception {
	       IUIContext ui = getUI();
	       ui.click(new EditorLocator().atRowCol(12, 3)); //new API?
	       ui.enterText(TEST_TEXT);
	       ui.assertThat(new TextAtRowColEqualsCondition(12,3, TEST_TEXT));                
	}
</code>
</pre>
<p>This makes for happy developers! :-) Communicating with a test
that drives us up to this snippet is a great jumpstart for
exploring the implementation of the feature and is a good starting
point for a conversation about the proposed API.</p>
