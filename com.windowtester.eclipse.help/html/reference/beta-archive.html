Features:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">TableCellLocator.hasText(..)</span>
- TableCellLocators can now be used to create HasTextConditions (for
example: <tt>ui.assertThat(new TableCellLocator("item 1",
"Value").hasText("yyy"))</tt>).</li>


  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">TreeItemLocator.isSelected()</span>
- TreeItemLocators now implement <tt>IsSelected </tt>and can now also be used to create IsSelectedConditions to test for the check-state of a tree item (for
example: <tt>ui.assertThat(new TreeItemLocator("Popeye").isSelected()</tt>).</li>




  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">New WT Intro Page Content</span>
- New WindowTester Pro Intro content pages have been added making it easier
to quickly navigate to useful resources from the Universal Intro Page.</li>




  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Assertion UI Activated</span> -
The assertion generation UI that has been considered experimental until
now, has been promoted to the main-stream and is now activated by
default.</li>




</ul>




Fixes:&nbsp;
<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">TableCellLocator Row and Column by-text Handling</span> - An issue preventing row and column text to be useable in specifiying&nbsp;table cell conditions (e.g.,&nbsp;<tt>new TableCellLocator("item 1",
"Value").isVisible()</tt>) has been fixed.</li>



  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Double-Escape Handling in TreeItem Paths</span> -TreeItem paths with double-escapes (e.g., "foo\\\\bar") where not being properly handled; this has been fixed..</li>





</ul>





<br>






<h3>Version 3.5.1 (beta) -- August 28, 2008</h3>






Fixes:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Drag And
Drop Source Caching</span> - drag sources that were established
using moveTo(..) were not reliably getting cached. This has been fixed.
  </li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">GEF Rendered
Pane Handling</span> - figures on rendered panes (such as those
used by GMF) require (and now get) special bounds (re)translation.
  </li>






</ul>






<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






</span>
<h3>Version 3.5.1 (beta) -- August 20, 2008</h3>






Fixes:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure
Matcher Visibility Testing</span> - The default figure matcher
implementation now ensures figures are visible (rejecting figures that
are not showing as indicated by the <tt>IFigure.isShowing()</tt>
method).</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Runtime
DragTo Handling with Figures as Targets (revisited for XYs)</span>
- A bug in the runtime Drag and Drop support where the drag target is a
figure and is wrapped in an XY locator has been addressed and fixed.</li>






</ul>






<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






</span>
<h3>Version 3.5.1 (beta) -- August 3, 2008</h3>






Fixes:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">ScreenCapture
improvements</span> - ScreenCapture handling has been improved to
be more robust in the face of out of memory conditions. It is also now
more user-configurable. See <a href="javadoc/com/windowtester/runtime/util/ScreenCapture.html">ScreenCapture</a>
for details.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">RCP Ant
Example Documentation Update</span> - The documentation for the
RCP Ant example has been updated to reflect refactoring in progress.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Runtime
DragTo Handling with Figures as Targets</span> - Runtime Drag and
Drop support has been improved for the case where the drag target is a
figure.</li>






</ul>






<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






</span>
<h3>Version 3.5.1 (beta) -- July 17, 2008</h3>






Fixes:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Javadoc
improvements</span> - The docs for <tt>IUIContext.keyClick(int)</tt>
were improved to better describe composite key stroke specifications.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Table Item
Selection Recording</span> - A regression was fixed that was
causing double clicks on table items to be wrongly generated as single
clicks.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Mac Native
Library Linking</span> - The Cocoa JNI library was wrongly
specified. This has now been fixed. </li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">WT.END Key
Entry</span> - A bug preventing proper dispatch of "END"
keystrokes has been fixed.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">XY
Coordinates for Canvas Drops Fixed</span> - XY Coordinates for
drags to Canvas widgets were being (wrongly) discarded. This has now
been fixed and recorded drags to canvases should include proper XY
information.</li>






</ul>






<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






</span>
<h3>Version 3.5.1 (beta) -- July 8, 2008</h3>






Fixes:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">DragTo
Modifier Keys</span> - Modifier keys were being neglected by
calls to <tt>dragTo</tt>; this has now been fixed.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Runtime
handling of Menu Items w/ Slashes (and Shortcuts)</span> - The
MenuItem path tokenizer has been fixed to handle corner cases with
slashes (e.g., "Find/Replace...") and accelerators/shortcuts.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">JobsCompleteCondition
Now Ignores EPP UDC Jobs</span> - The JobsCompleteCondition has
been updated to ignore EPP Usage Data Collector jobs by default.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Conditions
Handled During Exception Handling</span> - Registered conditions
are now handled during shell tear down when for failed tests. This
provides a hook for developers who need to participate in teardown. An
example of where this is handy is in the case where a closed shell
gives rise to a confirmation dialog. In order to not go into an
infinite regress when the framework tries to close the shells, a
condition can be registered to handle the nested dialog properly.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">One Time
Setup/Teardown</span> - The logic to manage the test lifecycle
has been improved and onetime class setup and teardown methods are now
being called as expected.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">ViewLocator.forName(..)</span>
- A new factory for View Locators has been implemented, allowing
testers to specify views by name (vs. id).</li>






</ul>






<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






</span>
<h3>Version 3.0.1 (beta) -- June 11, 2008</h3>






Features:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Palette
Button Recording</span> - Interactions with GEF palette buttons
(e.g., the control used to hide/reveal the palette) now generate <code>PaletteButtonLocator</code>
selections.</li>






</ul>






Fixes:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Dynamic Tree
Content Handling Fix</span> - Dynamic trees contain "dummy" items
as placeholders for their dynamic content which were confusing our
finder. These placeholders are now properly handled. </li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Test
Execution Notification Fix</span> - Timeouts in tests were
bypassing our test finished event notification compromising some test
lifecycle management (e.g., resetting of JFace Automation flags). </li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Palette Item
Selection Fix/Workaround For Redesigned GEF Palette</span> - In
GEF 3.4RC3, a quirk in the newly redesigned palette model broke
selections of the "Marquee" tool. This issue has now been addressed in
our EditPartFinder. </li>






</ul>






<h3>Version 3.0.1 (beta) -- May 29, 2008</h3>






Features:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Recorder
Console Enabled by Default</span> - The recorder console has made
it out of its experimental period and is now on by default. The
"classic" recorder can be re-enabled from the WindowTester Pro Recorder UI
preferences. For more details, see the online help docs. </li>






</ul>






Fixes:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">GEF Runtime
Transaction Fix</span> - Transactions triggered by actions on a
GEF canvas are waited for. In cases where a modal dialog was popped up
before the transaction was complete, this wait was timing out (pending
interaction with the dialog). This case is now handled (the wait is
canceled). </li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">JUnit38Runner
Fixed</span> - The provisional JUnit38 runner provided for JUnit4
compatibility had a faulty filter implementation that has been fixed.</li>






</ul>






<h3>Version 3.0.1 (beta) -- May 20, 2008</h3>






Fixes:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Empty Shell
Showing Fixes</span> - Transient shells that were causing
spurious wait calls to be generated are now being identified and
ignored by the recorder.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Debugging
Warnings Changed to Traces</span> - When the recorder cannot find
the control with current focus it used to add a remark to the log, this
is now a trace (and will only be seen if tracing is enabled).</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Recorder DND
Glitches Fixed</span>
- A number of issues in GEF DND recording have been addressed: a bug
that caused empty dragTo(..) events to be codegened has been fixed; and
drag events whose source selection is missing from the recording
(because there was no explicit click before the drag) are being
repaired at codegen-time.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Ant Example
Documentation Updated</span>
- The ant example docs were updated to include a tip about properly
setting up proxy host information. (Thanks to Fabian Leuthold for
pointing this out!)</li>






</ul>






Features:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">CTabItem
Close Runtime support</span>
- CTabItems can now be closed by passing a CTabItemLocator into the
ui.close(..) method. Closing this way rather than by using a relative
XY to locate the 'X' on the tab is not only more robust but also better
communicates intent in the test. </li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">CTabItem
Close Recorder support</span> - CTabItem interactions no longer
include XY information. In case the CTabItem was closed, a call to
ui.close(..) will be generated. </li>






</ul>






<h3>Version 3.0.1 (beta) -- April 30, 2008</h3>






Fixes:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">GEF Scroll
and Reveal Fixes</span> - Fixes were made to the GEF runtime to
better handle scrolling and revealing items on a figure canvas during
selection.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">GEF Palette
Item Revealing Strategy</span> - The strategy used to reveal
palette items when the palette is hidden has been updated to pin the
palette. This fix addresses potential timing issues where clicks on
items occur as the palette is opening or closing.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">TreeItemLocator
Empty Child Reveal Fixes</span> - Handling of the case where a
tree item selection is attempted on a branch that does not exist has
been improved. (The new behavior is to throw a search exception where
before there was an expansion timeout exception.)</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Recorder
Console Swing Improvements</span> - The Recorder console now has
improved labels for Swing element selections.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Filtered
Tree Item Recording fixes</span> - The recorder has been fixed to
recognize filtered trees.</li>






</ul>






<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>






</span>
<h3>Version 3.0.1 (beta) -- April 15, 2008</h3>






Features:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">WT File
System Target Provisioner Wizard</span>
- A new wizard has been added to drive the creation of a custom target
provisioner that provides the WindowTester Pro plugins required to record
and playback tests. &nbsp;Such a provisioner comes in handy in
cases
where developers are devloping against a target that is not based on
the IDE itself (which automatically has all of the WT libraries
installed). &nbsp;NOTE: this is a work in progress... &nbsp;;)</li>






</ul>






<h3>Version 3.0.1 (beta) -- April 2, 2008</h3>






Fixes:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">FAQ Updated</span>
- Instructions for enabling foreign keyboard support have been added to
the FAQ.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">MenuItemLocator
and native dialog misbehavior</span> - menu item selections that
launched native dialogs were hanging in Eclipse 3.3. This regression
has been fixed.</li>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">SectionLocator
Fixes</span> - a bug in the section child index finding algorithm
was fixed. This bug made it impossible to collect (using a findAll(..))
all the children of a Section.</li>






</ul>






Features:
<br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">LabeledLabelLocator
Implemented</span> - A new locator for locating labeled labels
has been added.</li>






</ul>






<h3>Version 2.3.1 (beta) -- February 8, 2008</h3>






Fixes:
<br>






<ul>






  <li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Updated <a href="../samples/ant_sample.html">Ant Example</a></span>
--- &nbsp; Changed test script to use <a href="javadoc/com/windowtester/runner/WindowTesterRunner.html">com.windowtester.runner.application</a>

<h3>Version 2.3.1 (beta) -- released January 22, 2008</h3>






<span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><br>






<ul>






  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">New
MenuItemLocator condition factories</span> --- &nbsp;<strong></strong>New
condition factory methods on the SWT&nbsp; menu item locator allow
you
to test enablement and check state easily. &nbsp;For example, to
test
enablement you would write&nbsp;<code>assertThat(new
MenuItemLocator("Window/Close All Perspectives").isEnabled())</code>.
&nbsp;To verify checked state: <code>assertThat(new
MenuItemLocator("Project/Build Automatically").isSelected())</code>.</li>






</ul>






<span style="font-weight: bold;">
</span>
<h3>Version 2.3.1 (beta) -- released December 21, 2007</h3>






<span style="font-style: italic;">Features:
</span><br>






<ul style="font-style: italic;">






  <li>Added support to change the keyboard type to current locale
during the test.</li>






</ul>






<div style="margin-left: 40px;">For
example, If current locale is German / Germany, and the test needs to
use the German Keyboard to enter text, then in the test have the
statement
<br>






</div>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>






<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WT.setWTLocaleToCurrent();</span>
<br>






</div>






<br>






<div style="margin-left: 40px;">From then on, all text
will be entered using the German keyboard mapping. At the end of the
tests, in order to set it back to the US Keyboard use
<br>






</div>






<br>






<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WT.resetWTLocale();</span>
