<h1>Eclipse 3.4 Cache Problem</h1>

<p>Due to a <a	href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=232094">p2 bug in Eclipse 3.4</a>, every time you&nbsp;uninstall or move a plugin or .link
file you need to do the following to clear the Eclipse cache:</p>

<p>The best solution is to start with a fresh copy of Eclipse but if you don't want to do that, try the following:</p>

<p>1. Uninstall/delete plugin and .link files. The .link files are located in your eclipse\dropins directory. </p>
<p>2. Restart Eclipse with the -clean option to clear the cache.</p>
<p>3. Open the bundles.info file in your Eclipse configuration\directory
to verify that references to the old installations are gone. If for some
reason, it's still there, you'll have to unzip a fresh copy of Eclipse.</p>
<p>4. Install plugin as usual and start Eclipse.</p>
<p>If that does not work try restoring
the&nbsp;\eclipse\configuration and \eclipse\p2 directories from the
original eclipse zip file.</p>
<p><strong>If that still doesn't work, your best bet is to
start with a fresh copy of Eclipse.</strong></p>
