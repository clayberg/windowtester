h2. Closing the Welcome Screen

Sometimes when I record I don't get the Welcome screen but when I run my tests the welcome screen is open which causes my tests to fail. How do I determine if the Welcome screen is open so I can close it? To address this issue in our tests, we use this common @setUp()@ method:

bc.. protected void setUp() throws Exception {
   getUI().ensureThat(ViewLocator.forName("Welcome").isClosed());
}
p. 

or, using static imports (and the @EclipseLocators@ factory class):

bc.. protected void setUp() throws Exception {
   getUI().ensureThat(view("Welcome").isClosed());
}
p.
