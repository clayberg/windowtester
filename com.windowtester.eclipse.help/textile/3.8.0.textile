h2. Runtime

The WindowTester Pro core runtime has evolved to support a new notion of condition handling.

* __Ensuring Conditions__ - UI contexts now support the @ensureThat(..)@ protocol.  Ensuring conditions is a useful ingredient in writing communicative and robust tests.  See our expanded "assertions documentation":../reference/assertions.html for more details. 

h2. Recording

In concert with the runtime, the recorder has been improved to leverage conditions and handlers.

* __Welcome Handling in RCP Applications__ - The RCP recorder now recognizes opportunities to improve recorded interactions by inserting a "Welcome" page handler into the recorded event stream.

h2. Code Generation

Code generation has been enhanced to take advantage of the new recording and runtime capabilities.

* __SetUp Handling__ - The code generator builds an appropriate @setUp()@ method that establishes test preconditions as determined by the recorder.

* __Linux Stability Issues__ - A number of Linux stability issues have been addressed.

* __Embedded Swing Components__ - The Swing widget finder has been improved to handle AWT/Swing components that are embedded in SWT Controls.

* __Swing UI Context mouseMove Support__ - The Swing implementation of @IUIContext.mouseMove(..)@ has been fixed.
