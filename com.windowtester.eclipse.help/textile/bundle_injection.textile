<h1>Dynamically Injecting Required Recording Bundles</h1>
The WindowTester Pro event recorder uses a standard launch configuration to launch the application to record.  For the recorder to work, a number of our bundles/plug-ins need to be present in the runtime. These plug-ins can be included in the launch configuration either <b>manually</b>, by selecting the bundles in the Plug-ins tab of the launch configuration or <b>dynamically</b>, by letting WindowTester Pro inject those bundles into the classpath of the launch configuration. Bundle injection is an option in the recording launch configuration's <b>Recorder tab</b> that can be set manually before launching a recording session.

If the option, <b>"Inject required WindowTester Pro bundles dynamically if needed"</b>,  is enabled and any of the recording bundles is missing from the launch configuration, the bundles will be injected dynamically without user interaction. If the option is not enabled, the user is asked to confirm whether to inject the bundles dynamically.

Selecting <b>No</b> will launch the application to record but it <b> may</b> or <b>may not</b> show the recording control.
Selecting <b>Yes</b> will do the following:
*  Dynamically inject the required recorder bundles into the classpath of the launch configuration.
*  Launch the application to record and open the <a href="recording_control.html">recording control</a>.
*  Enable the option in the recording launch configuration to inject the bundles dynamically if needed.  This ensures that the next time a recording is launched using the same launch configuration, the user will not be prompted again.
