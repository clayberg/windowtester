<body><h1>Version Naming Convention</h1>
<p>We use the same general naming convention that
Eclipse uses. The version number consists of a three digit release
number followed by a 12 or 15 digit qualifier. For example, a
release carries the following version number: 6.3.0.r34x200912021814.</p>

<p>The first three digits change to reflect the major release or beta
stream just as they do with Eclipse. As we put out major updates every
3-6 months, you will see those numbers change a couple of times a year.
The qualifier portion of the version number, however, will change with
every build so that they can be differentiated.</p>
