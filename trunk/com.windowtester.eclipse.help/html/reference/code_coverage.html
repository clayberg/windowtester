<p>WindowTester Pro provides tools that make it easy to understand what
parts of an application are exercised when one or more WindowTester Pro
tests are executed. Within WindowTester Pro, Code Coverage tools measure
how much of your code is being executed and provide various statistics.
Probably the most common reason for measuring code coverage is to
evaluate the effectiveness of test code at exercising all possible
paths through the code. Each time the developer measures a particular
class when running WindowTester Pro, a coverage report will be generated.
If the same class is measured multiple times, past versions of the
report will be remembered so that those versions can be compared. Code
coverage results can be displayed in graphical chart formats as well as
showing details about the coverage results.</p>
