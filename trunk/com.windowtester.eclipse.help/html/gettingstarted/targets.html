<h1>Adding WindowTester Pro Plug-ins to custom PDE targets</h1>
<p>When developing applications that share the same plug-in
configuration as the eclipse IDE, nothing special needs to be done to
add the WindowTester Pro libraries to your environment. &nbsp;On the other
hand,&nbsp; if you are developing against a custom target that is not
based on the IDE, you will need to add the <b>WindowTester Pro plugins</b> to your
target yourself.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Creating a WindowTester Pro File System Target Provisioner</h3>
<p>The first step is to create a provisioner based on your current
WindowTester Pro installation. &nbsp;To do this, start the <b>New WindowTester Pro
Target Provisioner</b> wizard. Open the New Wizard Selector:
<b>File &gt; New &gt; Other...</b> and select <b>WindowTester Pro > WindowTester Pro Target Provisioner</b>.</p>
<br>
<img src="../../images/newWizSelector.png" alt="New Target Provisioner Dialog">
<br>
<p>Click <b>Next></b> and specify the type of target you want to
create and choose a destination for the created target.</p>
<br>
<img src="../../images/targetProvisionerWiz.png" alt="Select Type of Target">
<p>Once the target has been created, you can use it in one of two
ways:</p>
<h3>Step 2 option 1: Add WindowTester Pro Target Plugins to Your Target Platform</h3>
<p>You can add the WindowTester Pro target plugins to your target platform by
opening the <b>Target Platform</b> PDE preference page (Window > Preferences > Plug-in Development > Target Platform), clicking <b>Add...</b></p>
<br><img src="../../images/targetPrefs.png" alt="Add"><br>
<p>selecting <b>File System</b> from the list of provisioner types:</p>
<br><img src="../../images/addPlugins.png" alt="">
<p>and then click <b>Browse...</b> and pointing to where you created your target provisioner:</p>
<br><img src="../../images/browseForTarget.png" alt="Browse For Target">
<p>Finallly, click <b>Reload </b>then <b>Add Required Plug-ins</b>:</p>
<img src="../../images/reload.png" alt="Reload"><br>
<h3>Step 2 option 2: Add WindowTester Pro Target Plugins to Your Target Definition</h3>
<p>If you use a target definition file, add the target directory to your
target definition by clicking the <b>Add...</b> button in the <b>Additional
Locations</b> section of the target overview.</p>
<br><img src="../../images/targeDef.png" alt="Add Target Location"><br>
<p>Browsing, as above, to the target's location on disk. &nbsp;Finally, be sure to reload your target  and add required plugins (see
above).</p>
<h3><a name="validate_plugins">Step 3: Validate Plug-ins</a></h3>
<p>If the <b>Recorder control does not appear</b> or the <b>Record button is disabled</b> when you launch a recording, it's likely due to a missing plug-in. 
One way to find out what plug-ins are missing is to click the <b>Validate Plug-ins</b> button in your recording launch configuration. If something is missing,
you should see something like this window:<br> <img src="../../images/missing_plugin.png" alt="Missing Plug-in"></p>
<p>If this is the case, find that bundle  in your eclipse installation's plugins directory
and then copy it into the file provisioner you made with the WT plugins in it.  
You'll probably need to reload your provisioner too. When this is done, you should see the junit.org plugin 
available in your launch configuration's list of available plugins.  
Once it is, select it and retry recording. </p>
