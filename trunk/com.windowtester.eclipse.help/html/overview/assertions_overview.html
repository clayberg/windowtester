<h1 id="CodeAssertionsinWindowTester Pro">Code Assertions in
WindowTester Pro</h1>
<p>Interacting with an application under test (<strong>AUT</strong>)
is only half of the story. In order to <i>verify</i> facts about the
AUT, WindowTester Pro provides a rich assertion story.</p>
<h2 id="AssertionsatRecordingTime">Assertions at Recording-Time</h2>
<p>During a recording session, a tester can create two kinds of
assertions.</p>
<h3 id="LocatorSpecificAssertions">Locator-Specific Assertions</h3>
<p>Using the <a href="../ui/assertionsUI.html">assertion
inspector</a>, a tester can make assertions about properties of specific
widgets located in the AUT. For example, if we are testing a wizard
page, we might at some point want to verify that the "Finish" button is
disabled. The generated code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>ui.assertThat(new ButtonLocator("Finish").isEnabled(false));
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<h3 id="AssertionHooks">Assertion Hooks</h3>
<p>If there is no existing locator-supported assertion for the
property in question, a tester can use the <a
	href="../ui/recording_control.html">recording control</a> to create an
<strong>assertion hook</strong> as a means to place-mark a spot where
there is some state they want to check in the generated code. An
assertion hook creates a <strong>code stub</strong> in the generated
code where the developer can later define the logic of the assertion. An
example assertion hook might look like so in the generated code:</p>
<pre><code>public void verifyNetworkState() {
	//TODO: fill out assertion logic
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<h2 id="RuntimeSupportforAssertions">Runtime Support for Assertions
</h2>
<p>The WindowTester Pro runtime provides a rich library of conditions
that can be used to build assertions. For more on assertions see <a
	href="../reference/assertions.html">here</a>.</p>
