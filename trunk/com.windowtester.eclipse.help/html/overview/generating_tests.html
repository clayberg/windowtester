<body><h1>Generating Tests</h1>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="windowtester.html">WindowTester Pro
</a>is a test case generator that creates tests in pure
Java. WindowTester Pro
is useful for both individual developer tests and
system tests&mdash;in a
development environment where code is checked in daily.
WindowTester Pro contains
a recording console that captures and records&nbsp;keyboard clicks
and mouse movements. The first step in test development is
to turn on the Record
feature and then work with various elements of the UI such
as windows or
buttons. WindowTester Pro will capture the steps taken. The tool
includes intelligent
parsing and unique identification of UI widgets that
provides feedback to
the developer about specific areas of the code. Since the tool
generates the tests
in pure Java, generated tests are easy to understand, modify
and maintain.<br><br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">WindowTester Pro
can also be used to generate system level tests to
test interactions
with software components created by other developers.
For example,
the QA team could bring up a variety of screens and
launch various tools
while recording, thus mimicking the actions of a user. This
kind of test would
test screens but also do things like accessing databases and
test other functional
areas of the application. This is a more comprehensive
kind of test, testing
sequences, branching and flow through a series of screens
via the "user experience". <br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;"> Once
the GUI has been exercised,
the developer closes
the application under test. When the application is closed,
the recording is terminated
and the developer is presented with a UI Test
Generation wizard. Here
the developer specifies the location of the test class and
whether build dependencies
should be added automatically.<br><br>Related topics:<br><ul><li><a href="running_tests.html">Running Tests</a></li><li><a href="../reference/assertions.html">Adding Assertions</a></li></ul>
