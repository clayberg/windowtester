h1. Running Tests

WindowTester Pro tests are run or played back just like any other JUnit tests. 

* __RCP and Plug-in tests__ are run as *JUnit Plug-In Tests* and 
* __SWT stand-alone application and Swing tests__ are run as *JUnit Tests*. 

These standard test configurations are accessible from a context menu in the *Package Explorer* or *Java Editor*.

h3. Viewing Results

Test results are displayed in the standard *JUnit view*.

If a test fails, WindowTester Pro provides a stack trace identifying the point of failure.
