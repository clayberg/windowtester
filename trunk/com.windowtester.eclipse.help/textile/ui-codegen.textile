<h1>Code Generation</h1>

Once a test is recorded, there are a number of ways the generated test can be specialized.

h2. Selecting a Custom Base Test Class

It often makes sense to create "reusable base test classes":../programmer/core/Custom_Base_Test.html that define reusable fixture setup logic.  These base tests can be specified in the **New UI Test** wizard.

h2. Specifying Setup Handlers

Robust tests are independent in that they depend very little on pre-established application state.  Test independence can be promoted by capturing all of the test's expectations about the application under state in __setup condition handlers__ defined in the test's @setUp@ method.  Common conditions can be selected in the **New UI Test** wizard.
