Provides classes and interfaces for writing UI tests using the WindowTester API.
<p>
WindowTester test cases are subclasses of {@link com.windowtester.runtime.common.UITestCaseCommon} which is a
special JUnit test case, tailored for running User Interface (UI) tests.  These test cases interact with
the UI using an instance of {@link com.windowtester.runtime.IUIContext} which is retrieved from
the <code>UITestCase</code> using it's <code>com.windowtester.internal.runtime.UIContextCommon#getUIContext()</code> method.
<code>IUIConext</code> supports common UI actions like entering text,
clicking widgets, dragging and dropping components and so on.
</p><p>
UI Tests are made robust using <em>Conditions</em>.  Conditions implement the
{@link com.windowtester.runtime.condition.ICondition} interface.

Common uses for Conditions include:

<ul>
  <li> <b>waiting</b> - tests can be paused until a condition is satisfied using the {@link com.windowtester.runtime.IUIContext#wait(ICondition)} method; 
  		for example, one might want to pause test execution until a file is created in the file system, a job is complete, a widget is updated and so on. 
  </li>
  <li> <b>asserting</b> - properties of the system can be asserted using the {@link com.windowtester.runtime.IUIContext#assertThat(ICondition)} method;
  		for example, one might want to assert that a particular widget is visible, has focus, has text that matches an expected String and so on.
  </li>
</ul>

Conditions can also be registered
with the runtime's {@link com.windowtester.runtime.condition.IConditionMonitor} and used
to trigger {@link com.windowtester.runtime.condition.IHandler} instances.  Shell Conditions
(implemented as {@link com.windowtester.runtime.swt.condition.shell.IShellCondition} instances) are
special conditions used to test conditions on shells.  Registering handlers to
handle shell conditions is helpful in cases where shell appearances are hard to predict
(such as progress monitors).  Shell handlers are associated with the runtime through
the UI Context's {@link com.windowtester.runtime.swt.condition.shell.IShellMonitor} instance.
Finally conditions can also be used to <em>ensure that</em> properties are true using the {@link com.windowtester.runtime.IUIContext.ensureThat(IConditionHandler)} method.
