DEPRECATED: Provides specialized shell condition handling support to
the WindowTester runtime.<br>

Use&nbsp;<code>com.windowtester.runtime.swt.condition.shell</code>
instead.
<p>ShellConditions
(implemented as {@link
com.windowtester.runtime.swt.condition.shell.IShellCondition}s) are
special conditions used to test conditions on shells. Registering
handlers to
handle shell conditions is helpful in cases where shell appearances are
hard to predict
(such as progress monitors). Shell handlers are associated with the
runtime through
the UI Context's {@link
com.windowtester.runtime.swt.condition.shell.IShellMonitor} instance.
