Provides classes and interfaces for custom widget resolvers.
<p>In the WindowTester runtime, widgets can be resolved in three
ways:
</p>

<ol>

  <li> <em>Named widgets</em> are identified and
retrieved by their names which are set using the {@link
org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget#setData(java.lang.String,
java.lang.Object)} method where the name key is the String "name". For
example, naming a widget "my.widget" could be done as follows:
    <pre> Widget w = ...;<br> w.setData("name", "my.widget");<br> </pre>

Having named this widget this way, it can be retrieved from the
UIContext by this name:
    <pre> IUIContext ui = ...;<br> Widget myWidget = ui.find("my.widget");<br> <br> //guaranteed to be true<br> TestCase.assertEquals(w, myWidget);<br> </pre>

  </li>

  <li> Widgets with associated <em>Widget Resolvers</em>
are found using custom resolvers, classes that implement the {@link
com.windowtester.swt.resolver.IWidgetResolver} interface. Resolvers
that are registered with the UIContext are associated with handles that
can be used to make the widget they identify appear as if it were named
to the test writer. Widget resolvers are registered with the UIContext
using the {@link com.windowtester.swt.resolver.IWidgetResolverService}.
  </li>

  <li> Finally, widgets can be identified by their <em>location</em>
in the widget hierarchy. Widget locations are described by instances of
the {@link com.windowtester.swt.WidgetLocator} class. <code>WidgetLocator</code>s
are also registered with the UIContext (see: {@link
com.windowtester.swt.IUIContext#register(String, WidgetLocator)}). Once
a widget locator is registered to a String handle with the UIContext,
the widget it describes can be retrieved from the UIContext by its
handle. </li>

</ol>

Like locators, widget resolvers provide a means to identify widgets
that were not named by the application developer. Resolvers are
especially useful when there is a convenient (and potentially
efficient) means to resolve a widget or in situations where uniquely
identifying location information is overly cumbersome or brittle.
