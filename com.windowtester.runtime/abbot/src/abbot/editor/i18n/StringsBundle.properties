# Default string properties for Costello (US English)
#
# Copyright (c) 2002-2005 Timothy Wall
#
# Each entry may be accompanied by a more extensive explanation of what
# information is being provided, to give a better idea of the context in which
# the string is presented.  These comments need not be included in any other
# property file.
#
# All i18n properties files must use ISO 8859-1 character encoding, using
# unicode escapes where required.  If you want to edit one of these files,
# use native2ascii -reverse, edit, then convert back with native2ascii.
#
# Property keys should be roughly hierarchical, more to keep them from
# conflicting than anything else.  Older keys don't follow this (the script
# pmv.sh is provided to change a few at a time).
#
# Mnemonic characters (those that show up with an underscore when activating 
# menus) are identified by preceding them with an ampersand (&).  If you want 
# to use a mnemonic that is outside the ASCII range, you must define the 
# mapping from the equivalent unicode to the desired ASCII keyboard key.  For
# example, 
#
# MNEMONIC_\u00d6=O 
#
# maps German "o umlaut" onto the "O" key.  See the 
# abbot.editor.widgets.Mnemonic class for more details.
#
# Some property keys ending with a short suffix have a special meaning:
# .desc: Short description of command "cmd", which may be used in a tooltip
# .ldesc: Long description of command, suitable for in-line help (optional).
# .acc: Accelerator (shortcut) keystroke (optional)
#       Use the string representation of a KeyStroke (see the javadoc for
#       KeyStroke).  For example, "O" for the "open" command, or "shift S" for
#       the Save AS command.  Does not have to correspond to any letters in
#       the command name, but every accelerator must be unique across all
#       accelerator keystrokes.  Do not include the shortcut modifier, but may
#       include a secondary modifier (e.g. shift). 
# .mn: Deprecated.  Use ampersand to indicate desired mnemonic character.
#       Mnemonic letter (for keyboard-based menu activation) (optional).
#       This should be a KeyEvent VK constant (the VK_ prefix may be omitted)
#       and correspond to one of the letters in the command name.  It must
#       not conflict with any other mnemonic in the same menu.
# .msg: Message in a dialog 
# .title: Title for a dialog or frame containing the base message.
#

# Do not put this key into any translation files! it is used to identify when
# the default properties have been loaded.
costello.DefaultPropertiesLoaded=yes

#
# Put all translatable properties here.  Don't worry too much about the order.
