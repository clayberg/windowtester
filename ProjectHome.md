Using WindowTester Pro, developers can easily create tests for every GUI they create. The tests generated by WindowTester Pro are standard JUnit tests thus they can be run within your Eclipse environment or they can be automated to run using Ant. Typically, tests are recorded on projects within your Eclipse environment.
